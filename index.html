             <p text-align="left"> <b> Bramshill House,</b> in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bramshill">Bramshill</a> , northeast Hampshire, England, is one of the largest and most important <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobean_architecture">Jacobean</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prodigy_house">prodigy house</a>  mansions in England. It was built in the early 17th century by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_la_Zouche,_11th_Baron_Zouche">Baron Edward la Zouche</a>  of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harringworth">Harringworth</a>  but was partly destroyed by fire a few years later. The design shows the influence of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_Renaissancehttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_Renaissance">Italian Renaissance</a> , which became popular in England during the late 16th century. The house was designated a Grade I <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Listed_building">listed building</a>  in 1952.
             <br>The mansion's southern façade is notable for its decorative architecture, which includes at its centre a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oriel_window">large oriel</a>  window above the principal entrance. Interior features include a great hall displaying 92 coats of arms on a Jacobean screen, an ornate drawing room, and a 126.5-foot-long (38.6 m) gallery containing many portraits. Numerous columns and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frieze">friezes</a>  are found throughout the mansion, while several rooms have large <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tapestry">tapestries</a>  depicting historical figures and events on their panelled walls. The house is set in 262 acres (106 ha) of grounds containing an 18-acre (7.3 ha) lake. The grounds, which received a Grade II* listing in 1984, are part of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Register_of_Historic_Parks_and_Gardens_of_Special_Historic_Interest_in_England">Registered Historic Park</a>  that includes about 25 acres (10 ha) of early 17th-century formal gardens near the house. The wider medieval park was landscaped from the 17th to the 20th century and contains woodland. 
             <br>
             Bramshill appears to have been a local sporting and social venue since the 16th century. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket">cricket</a>  ground at the house played host to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-class_cricket">first-class</a>  match in 1823 when an early <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hampshire_county_cricket_teams">Hampshire</a>  team played an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-international_England_cricket_teams">England</a>  XI, and it hosted three other matches in 1825–26. During the Second World War, the mansion was used as a Red Cross <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maternity_hospital">maternity home</a> , before becoming the residence of the exiled King <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_I_of_Romania">Michael</a>  and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_Anne_of_Romania">Queen Anne of Romania</a>  for a number of years. It became the location of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_Staff_College,_Bramshill">Police Staff College</a>  in 1960, and was later home to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Police_College">European Police College</a> . As a result, many campus buildings have been added to the estate. Owing to escalating maintenance costs the property was sold to the heritage property developers City & Country in August 2014. Among the 14 ghosts reputed to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haunted_house">haunt</a>  the house is that of a bride who accidentally locked herself in a chest on her wedding night and was not found until 50 years later.
